## Installation

### Software Dependencies 

* [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP), a multi-threading library for parallel processing on multi-core CPUs. 
* [libTIFF](http://www.libtiff.org/), which gives support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image data.
* [libhdf5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/cpplus_RM/index.html), or the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) library for stroring data.
* [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), a template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
