# Introduction

## Features

## Installation

### Software Dependencies 

* [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP), a multi-threading library for parallel processing on multi-core CPUs. 
* [libTIFF](http://www.libtiff.org/), which gives support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image data.
* [libhdf5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/cpplus_RM/index.html), or the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) library for stroring data.

### Supported Operating Systems 

Ultraliser has been tested on Unix-based operating systems including:

* Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04
* RedHat 
* macOS 10.12 Sierra, 10.13 High Sierra,  10.14 Mojave, 10.15 Catalina

### Installation instructions

First you need to install the dependencies (here shown for a Linux system)

```
sudo apt-get install libomp-dev
sudo apt-get install hdf5-devel
```

Next, you can install Ultraliser with the following commands
