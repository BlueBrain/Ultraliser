# Introduction

_Ultraliser_ is an __unconditionally robust__ and __high-performance__ framework dedicated primarily to **_in silico_ neuroscience** research. 
_Ultraliser_ is capable of generating high fidelity and multiscale 3D models (surface meshes and annotated volumes) of neuroscientific data, such as nuclei, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula, 
neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, neuronal branches with dendritic spines, minicolumns with thousands of neurons and large networks of cerebral vasculature - with realistic geometries. 

_Ultraliser_ implements an effective __voxelization-based remeshing engine__ that can rasterize non-watertight surface meshes - in the 
form of __triangular soups__ - into high-resolution volumes, with which we can reconstruct topologically accurate, adaptively optimized, 
and watertight surface manifolds. 

In addition to their importance for accurate quantitative analysis, the resulting models are primarily intended to automate the 
process of conducting supercomputer-based _in silico_ simulations of neuroscience experiments; complementing _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ 
techniques. 

Watertight triangular meshes are used for (i) performing 3D particle simulations, (ii) mesh-based skeletonization, in which accurate morphologies of cellular structures are obtained for performing 1D compartmental simulations and (iii) tetrahedralization, in which we can generate tetrahedral volume meshes for 3D reaction-diffusion simulations.
Annotated volumetric tissue models are also used in _in silico_ imaging studies, where we can simulate optical imaging experiments with brightfield or fluorescence microscopy<sup>10</sup>. 

## Features 

+ Reconstruction of high fidelity, optimized<sup>1</sup>, and two-manifold watertight<sup>2</sup> triangular mesh models from non-watertight inputs represented by polygonal soups. 
+ Surface mesh smoothing and optimization using [Laplacian operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_smoothing) and feature-preserving adaptive mesh optimization<sup>1</sup>.
+ Reconstruction of large-scale volumetric models<sup>3</sup> from non-watertight input meshes using high-performance [surface and solid voxelization](Mesh-Voxelization). 
+ Reconstruction of optimized and smooth surface meshes from input volumes using parallel implementations of the standard marching cubes<sup>4</sup> algorithm and the advanced dual marching cubes<sup>5</sup> algorithm. 
+ Reconstruction of optimized and smooth surface meshes from input binary masks of segmented data. 
+ Reconstruction of geometrically realistic watertight mesh models of spiny neurons from corresponding morphological skeletons<sup>6</sup>.
+ Reconstruction of geometrically realistic watertight mesh models of complete astroglial cells<sup>8</sup>  (with endfeet) from input morphological skeletons and endfeet surface patches<sup>9</sup>.        
+ Reconstruction of high-fidelity, optimized, and multi-partitioned vascular meshes from fragmented and large-scale vascular network graphs<sup>7</sup>. 
+ Morphology, mesh, and volume quantitative and qualitative analysis. 
+ Generation of color-coded multi-axis projections of spatial data (morphologies, meshes, and volumes) for visual analytics.
